# Medicine Inventory Tracker — handover

## Current state

- Product: household medicine inventory (responsive web). Long-term: optional native clients; not a commercial store product.
- Repository: https://github.com/sudoku0412-stack/medicine-inventory-tracker (public).
- **Production:** https://medicineinventory.craftloop.ca — Cloudflare Worker + D1 + R2 + KV, protected by **Cloudflare Access**. Deploy: `deploy/cloudflare-workers.md`, `npm run deploy`.
- **Local dev:** Node 26+, `npm start` → http://127.0.0.1:3000, SQLite under `data/`. Static UI in `public/`. Run `npm test`.
- **Secrets (never commit):** local `data/gemini.key`, `data/vapid.json`, `.env`; cloud Wrangler secrets (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, optional `ACCESS_*`).

## What is on `main` (merged)

| PR | Topic |
| --- | --- |
| Phase 1 (1606a91) | Dashboard, inventory, in-app expiry reminders |
| #1 | Monthly cabinet check button |
| #2 | Packaging photos + confirmed suggestions |
| #3 | Web push expiry alerts (service worker) |
| #4 | Gemini packaging scan |
| #5 | `app.js` parse fix + form `autocomplete` |
| #6 | Live camera for **Take photo** (Chrome / phone HTTPS) |
| #8 | Always-on Cloudflare deploy (Worker, D1, R2, KV) |

**Open PRs:** none (as of last check).

**Follow-up on `main` after #8:** pin D1/KV ids in `wrangler.toml`, R2 setup notes, trust Access edge header for API after login, `credentials` on API `fetch` — landed via handover branch / small PR if not yet merged.

## Delivered behavior

- Batches: name, strength, form, quantity, unit, low-stock threshold, expiry (or unknown), location, notes; consume / discard; status filters and search.
- Optional pack photos (JPEG/PNG/WebP, 2 MB). **Take photo** uses camera on HTTPS; **Upload photo** uses file picker. Gemini suggests name/expiry when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set; saving the form is confirmation.
- In-app 30-day expiry reminders; optional **Enable expiry alerts** (web push). Cloud cron delivers push on Workers; local uses `npm start` timer.
- Expiry rules: date-only calendar math, 30-day warning window.

## Phase 2 — done

1. Monthly cabinet check button (PR #1).
2. Packaging photos + AI suggest + confirm (PR #2, #4, #6).
3. Expiry delivery when app closed — web push (PR #3).

## Phase 3 — done (deploy)

Always-on hosting at **medicineinventory.craftloop.ca** without a home Mac or tunnel: Worker API, D1 inventory, R2 photos, KV for VAPID, Access login, Gemini via secret.

**Not done:** automatic import from an existing local `data/inventory.sqlite` into D1.

## Phase 4 — planned (profile; not started)

The UI already shows **Kaushik / KS** and a profile avatar; mobile **Profile** shows a toast: *“Profile settings are planned for the next phase.”*

Intended scope (to agree before build):

- Editable **display name** and **initials** (replace hardcoded copy in `public/index.html` / sidebar).
- Simple **profile / settings** view from avatar and mobile Profile (not full auth).
- Optional: household label (“Kaushik’s home”) — still **single household**, not multi-user sharing.

**Explicitly later (not Phase 4):** household sharing, iOS/Android apps, commercial store inventory.

## Working agreement

Do not launch Cursor cloud agents for this project. Read this file at the start of a new chat. Do not re-fix completed Phase 2 items unless a regression is found.
